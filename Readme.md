**DESCRIPTION OF MY CONTRIBUTION:**

CineCheck is a web-based movie tracker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The application allows users to add, manage, and track movies they've watched or plan to watch. It features a sleek, responsive design using Bulma CSS and custom styling with the Figtree font. Users can input movie details such as title, platform, actors, director, release year, and poster image. The interface includes a search function for easy movie lookup and a sortable table for better organization. The app utilizes local storage to save added movies, ensuring persistence across sessions. Easy-to-understand codebase with clear functions for adding, removing, and updating movie entries, making it highly customizable for further enhancements or integrations.
